"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams is a science fiction comedy novel that has become a cult classic since its publication in 1979. The story begins with an ordinary man named Arthur Dent, who discovers that his house is about to be demolished to make way for a new bypass. His day takes a dramatically bizarre turn when he learns that his friend Ford Prefect is actually an alien researcher for an electronic travel guide called "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Ford informs Arthur that the Earth is about to be destroyed by a bureaucratic alien race known as the Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass.

Just before Earth is annihilated, Ford and Arthur hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship, starting their journey across the galaxy. Along the way, they encounter a variety of eccentric characters, including Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed ex-President of the Galaxy; Trillian, the only other human survivor of Earth's destruction; Marvin, a depressed robot with a "brain the size of a planet"; and Slartibartfast, a planetary coastline designer.

It pokes fun at the absurdity of human institutions and the randomness of existence, all while taking readers on a fantastical journey through space.
