In a comfortable hobbit-hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit named Baggins. Unlike typical holes, his was cozy and well-furnished, with a green, round door, panelled walls, and many pegs for visitors' coats. The tunnel-like hall led to various rooms on the same level, with the best rooms on the left side, featuring windows overlooking the garden and meadows. The Baggins family, long-time residents of The Hill, were known for their wealth and predictability, never having adventures. However, this story recounts how Baggins unexpectedly embarked on an adventure, challenging his predictable lifestyle and potentially losing the neighbors' respect, but gaining something else in the process.
